## Introduction

The safe distribution of installation packages is an important task, the risk of a scam is high, blocking centralized resources (github.com) and other things. Currently, the installation packages of the node and desktop applications are distributed via github.com which is not the most reliable source.

Since recently, node releases (along with the source code archive) have been published in IPFS - `/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5djlu9x6vu3qclh0oocdm0ofla8zprnzm5rceiwhfigx65ujvn4s` (I urge everyone to participate in the distribution of this resource).

## Goals

Achieve a secure and reliable way to distribute the source code and installation packages of Bastyon/Pocketnet applications

## Non Goals

## Proposal

Mandatory use of decentralized platforms and solutions. Ideally, building a process inside the Bastyon network. There may be a publication of a SHA slice of the source code on the Bastyon network, self-assembly of the source code by a group of developers and signing with private keys, further publication (where?) installation packages with developer signatures. Users can independently verify the correctness of the uploaded files (bastyon.com/checksign ?), see the list of signatures and verify the hash sum.
