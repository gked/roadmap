## Introduction

I think we need to develop a common standard for file management README.md for all our repositories. The introduction of a single standard will make it easier to navigate the infrastructure and will have different access points to the necessary information through the documentation portal. Deeper documentation should be located in one place, where it will be intuitively easy to find and study, instead of exploring many repositories.

## Goals

- Establish a common standard for README.md files across all repositories.
- Simplify navigation and access to necessary information.
- Centralize deeper documentation in one intuitive location.

## Non Goals

- This document does not cover the specifics of individual repository content.
- It does not address the implementation details of the documentation portal.

## Proposal

- Develop a template for README.md files.
- Ensure all repositories adopt this template.
- Create a centralized documentation portal for deeper documentation.

## Examples

See [repo-readme-example.md](repo-readme-example.md)
